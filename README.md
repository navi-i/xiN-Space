Personal NixOS configuration.

Contains :
- KDE. 
- ZFS.
- ZFS Encryption.
- Erase your darlings.
- ZSH.
- Single GPU Passthrough using lbivirt/qemu.


Install guide for base NixOS ZFS setup is in this repository. I have not tested without ZFS, but if not using ZFS, simply remove all ZFS related lines in /system. 


  Still a work in progress.
